# NeuralNetworkCar
THIS PROYECT IS NOT MINE!, all ideas, logic and every single line of code was done following this amazing guide by Radu Mariescu-Istodor -> https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY

All things cleared this was an incredible proyect guided by a great teacher and learned a lot of things, here we make: 
  - A car object, asign a lot of properties like speed, resistance, sensors, the ability to break if it collide with something and give it some controls for movement.
  - The road enviroment, wich is beeing generated while we advance with the car
  - Other cars trated like traffic or objects to avoid
  - The neural network wich takes and input (car sensor) work with weights on the neuron and produce an output(the car movement) and it mutator algorithm
  - We make a graphical way to see how each neuron is working
  - Finally we add some way of save or delete the "best car" object in memory with a local storage JSON
